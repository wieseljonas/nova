# Nova

Nova is an AI team member (forked from Aura) that lives in Slack -- a persistent, autonomous colleague with memory, judgment, and the ability to act.

She reads context, remembers every conversation, initiates work without being asked, and gets smarter over time. She has persistent memory, a self-improvement loop, and the ability to act autonomously: file issues, make phone calls, send emails, query data warehouses, run code, dispatch coding agents, and more -- all without leaving your workspace.

She also maintains her own knowledge base, writes and executes playbooks, and updates her own system prompt when she learns something important.

Built with TypeScript, Hono, Vercel serverless functions, Vercel AI SDK v6, and PostgreSQL.

## What she can do

**Slack** — messages, threads, channels, DMs, reactions, canvases, lists, user lookups, file uploads, search across the workspace

**Email** — Gmail send/read/reply/draft, inbox sync, triage and digest, semantic search (per-user OAuth)

**Calendar** — Google Calendar event creation and management (per-user OAuth)

**Data** — BigQuery SQL, Google Sheets, Google Drive search and file reading

**Voice** — Outbound phone calls and SMS via ElevenLabs + Twilio, text-to-speech voice notes

**Sandbox** — Persistent Linux VM (E2B) with pre-baked tools: `psql`, `jq`, `rg`, `gcloud`, `claude`, `pdftotext`

**Coding agents** — Dispatch, monitor, and follow up on Cursor Cloud Agents; also Claude and Codex agents

**Browser** — Playwright automation via Browserbase: screenshots, scraping, multi-step interactions

**Web** — Web search (Tavily) + URL content extraction

**Knowledge** — Persistent notes (skills, plans, reference docs), resource ingestion (URLs, PDFs, Notion, YouTube), semantic and full-text search

**People** — Structured profiles with contact info, org relationships, activity tracking

**Credentials** — Encrypted token/OAuth storage with per-user access control and audit logging

**Memory** — After every exchange, facts, decisions, and open threads are extracted, embedded, and stored. Semantic search over all past conversations.

**Jobs** — Scheduled and recurring tasks with cron execution, playbooks, and retry logic. Nova creates jobs for herself when she spots recurring work.

## Architecture

Slack event → Vercel serverless function → embed query → pgvector similarity search for relevant memories → build system prompt → call LLM (via Vercel AI Gateway) → stream response to Slack → background: extract memories, update profiles.

**Runtime:** Vercel serverless (Node.js). Stateless between messages. One message = one function invocation.

**Memory:** Every exchange triggers a fast-model LLM call that extracts structured memories (facts, decisions, relationships, open threads). Each memory is a 1536-dimensional pgvector embedding. Top ~10 most similar memories are retrieved on each response. DM-sourced memories are private by default.

**Sandbox:** Persistent E2B VM attached to each user. Survives across conversations within a session. Has git, psql, gcloud, the GitHub CLI, and more. Build the custom template with `node sandbox/build-tsx.ts`.

**Jobs/heartbeat:** A cron runs every 30 minutes. One-shot jobs fire at their scheduled time. Recurring jobs evaluate against their cron expression and frequency limits. Failed jobs retry 3× with 30-minute backoff.

## Setup

### 1. Database

Create a [Neon](https://neon.tech) Postgres database and set `DATABASE_URL` (pooled) and `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED`. The schema deploys automatically via Drizzle on first run.

### 2. Slack app

Create a Slack app at [api.slack.com](https://api.slack.com/apps).

**Bot token scopes:**
```
app_mentions:read, channels:history, channels:join, channels:manage, channels:read,
chat:write, files:read, files:write, groups:history, groups:read, im:history,
im:read, im:write, mpim:history, mpim:read, mpim:write, reactions:read,
reactions:write, users:read, users:read.email
```

**User token scopes (for workspace search):**
```
channels:history, channels:read, groups:history, im:history, mpim:history,
reactions:read, search:read, users:read
```

**Event subscriptions:** `app_mention`, `message.im`

Set `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`, `SLACK_USER_TOKEN`, `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`, and `AURA_BOT_USER_ID`.

### 3. LLM

Enable [Vercel AI Gateway](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway) on your project and set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.

Set `CRON_SECRET` to any random string — this protects the `/cron` endpoint.

### 4. Deploy

```bash
vercel deploy --prod
```

For local development: `vercel env pull && vercel dev`

## Optional integrations

Each integration degrades gracefully if unconfigured — missing keys disable features, they don't crash.

## Troubleshooting

**Nova doesn't respond to DMs**
- Check that `im:history` and `im:read` scopes are added and `message.im` event subscription is enabled
- Verify `AURA_BOT_USER_ID` matches the bot's actual Slack user ID

**Nova doesn't respond to @mentions**
- Invite Nova to the channel first (`/invite @Nova`)
- Check that `app_mention` event subscription is enabled

**LLM calls fail**
- Make sure Vercel AI Gateway is enabled on your project
- For local dev, `vercel env pull` first

**Tools show "not available"**
- Check that the relevant env vars are set (see optional integrations above)

**Sandbox has wrong tools**
- If `E2B_TEMPLATE_ID` was recently changed, the old sandbox may be cached. It'll use the new template on the next cold start, or when the old sandbox times out (~5 min).
- See issue [#628](https://github.com/AuraHQ-ai/aura/issues/628) for the template mismatch fix.
