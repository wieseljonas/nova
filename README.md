# Aura v0

A Slack bot with persistent memory, personality, and cross-user awareness. Aura remembers every conversation, builds profiles of the people it talks to, and responds with a consistent, opinionated personality -- not like a tool, but like a colleague.

## What it does

- **Responds** in Slack DMs and channels (when @mentioned or addressed by name)
- **Remembers** everything -- facts, decisions, personal details, relationships, sentiments
- **Recalls** relevant context via semantic search across all past conversations
- **Adapts** its tone to each person's communication style
- **Respects privacy** -- DM content stays private unless explicitly shared
- **Forgets on request** -- users can ask "what do you know about me?" or say "forget X"

## Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Runtime | Node.js on Vercel (serverless functions) |
| Framework | [Hono](https://hono.dev) |
| LLM | [Vercel AI SDK 6](https://sdk.vercel.ai) + [AI Gateway](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/ai-sdk-providers/ai-gateway) |
| Database | [Neon](https://neon.tech) PostgreSQL + pgvector |
| ORM | [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team) |
| Slack | `@slack/web-api` + `@slack/bolt` (types) |

LLM provider is your choice. AI Gateway supports 20+ providers out of the box -- Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Mistral, xAI, DeepSeek, Meta, and more. You pick models via environment variables.

---

## Getting Started

Three things to set up: a **Neon database**, a **Slack app**, and the **Vercel deployment**. About 20 minutes end to end.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- A [Vercel](https://vercel.com) account with AI Gateway enabled
- A [Neon](https://neon.tech) account (free tier works)
- A [Slack](https://api.slack.com/apps) workspace where you can create apps

---

### Step 1: Clone and install

```bash
git clone <this-repo>
cd aura
npm install
```

Copy the environment template:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

You'll fill in the values in the steps below.

---

### Step 2: Create a Neon database

1. Go to [neon.tech](https://neon.tech) and create a new project
2. Name the database `aura` (or whatever you like)
3. Copy the connection string -- it looks like `postgresql://user:pass@ep-xxx.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/aura?sslmode=require`
4. Paste it into `.env` as `DATABASE_URL`

**Enable pgvector and create the schema:**

Open the **SQL Editor** in the Neon console (or connect with `psql`) and run the migration file:

```bash
# Option A: via psql
psql $DATABASE_URL -f src/db/migrations/0000_init.sql

# Option B: via Drizzle Kit (pushes schema from code)
npx drizzle-kit push
```

Both produce the same result. Use whichever you prefer.

To verify it worked, run in the SQL editor:

```sql
SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname = 'public';
```

You should see: `messages`, `memories`, `user_profiles`, `channels`.

---

### Step 3: Create a Slack app

1. Go to [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) and click **Create New App**
2. Choose **From scratch**
3. Name it `Aura`, pick your workspace, and create it

#### Bot Token Scopes

Go to **OAuth & Permissions** in the sidebar. Under **Bot Token Scopes**, add:

| Scope | Why |
|---|---|
| `app_mentions:read` | Receive @Aura mentions in channels |
| `channels:history` | Read messages in public channels |
| `channels:read` | List channels Aura is in |
| `chat:write` | Send messages |
| `groups:history` | Read messages in private channels |
| `groups:read` | List private channels Aura is in |
| `im:history` | Read DM messages |
| `im:read` | Access DM channel info |
| `im:write` | Open DMs |
| `mpim:history` | Read group DM messages |
| `mpim:read` | Access group DM channel info |
| `users:read` | Look up user profiles (display name, timezone) |

#### Install to workspace

Still on **OAuth & Permissions**, click **Install to Workspace** and authorize. Copy the **Bot User OAuth Token** (`xoxb-...`) into `.env` as `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`.

#### Signing secret

Go to **Basic Information** in the sidebar. Under **App Credentials**, copy the **Signing Secret** into `.env` as `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`.

#### Get the bot user ID

You need Aura's Slack user ID (starts with `U`). The easiest way:

1. Open Slack, find Aura in the member list
2. Click on its profile, click the three dots (**...**), click **Copy member ID**
3. Paste it into `.env` as `AURA_BOT_USER_ID`

Or via the API:

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $SLACK_BOT_TOKEN" \
  https://slack.com/api/auth.test | jq -r .user_id
```

#### Event subscriptions (do this after deploying -- see Step 5)

You'll come back to this after deployment. The event subscription URL needs your live Vercel URL. Skip to Step 4 and 5, then come back.

---

### Step 4: Choose your models

Aura uses three models, all routed through [Vercel AI Gateway](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/ai-sdk-providers/ai-gateway):

| Role | Env var | What it does | Example values |
|---|---|---|---|
| Main | `MODEL_MAIN` | Conversation responses | `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514`, `openai/gpt-4o`, `google/gemini-2.5-pro` |
| Fast | `MODEL_FAST` | Memory extraction, profile updates | `anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5`, `openai/gpt-4o-mini`, `google/gemini-2.5-flash` |
| Embedding | `MODEL_EMBEDDING` | Vectorizing memories and queries | `openai/text-embedding-3-small`, `voyage/voyage-3.5-lite`, `google/text-embedding-005` |

Set these in your `.env`:

```bash
MODEL_MAIN=anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514
MODEL_FAST=anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5
MODEL_EMBEDDING=openai/text-embedding-3-small
```

The format is always `provider/model`. See the [full list of available models](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/ai-sdk-providers/ai-gateway).

No API keys to manage -- Vercel AI Gateway handles provider access and billing.

---

### Step 5: Deploy to Vercel

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI if you haven't
npm i -g vercel

# Link to a Vercel project
vercel link

# Deploy
vercel --prod
```

After deployment, note your production URL (e.g., `https://aura-xxx.vercel.app`).

#### Configure environment variables

Go to your Vercel project dashboard -> **Settings** -> **Environment Variables** and add:

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Your Neon connection string |
| `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` | `xoxb-...` |
| `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` | From Slack app Basic Information |
| `AURA_BOT_USER_ID` | `U...` (Aura's Slack user ID) |
| `MODEL_MAIN` | e.g. `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514` |
| `MODEL_FAST` | e.g. `anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5` |
| `MODEL_EMBEDDING` | e.g. `openai/text-embedding-3-small` |
| `CRON_SECRET` | Any random string (protects the cron endpoint) |

Optional:

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `debug`, `info` (default), `warn`, `error` |

#### Redeploy

After setting env vars, trigger a redeployment:

```bash
vercel --prod
```

#### Verify

```bash
curl https://aura-xxx.vercel.app/api/health
# Should return: {"ok":true,"timestamp":"..."}
```

---

### Step 6: Connect Slack to your deployment

Go back to [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps), select your Aura app:

1. Go to **Event Subscriptions** in the sidebar
2. Toggle **Enable Events** to ON
3. Set the **Request URL** to:

   ```
   https://aura-xxx.vercel.app/api/slack/events
   ```

   Slack will send a challenge request. Your app handles this automatically -- you should see a green checkmark.

4. Under **Subscribe to bot events**, add:

   | Event | Why |
   |---|---|
   | `message.im` | DM messages |
   | `message.channels` | Public channel messages |
   | `message.groups` | Private channel messages |
   | `app_mention` | @Aura mentions |

5. Click **Save Changes**

Slack may ask you to reinstall the app. Do so.

---

### Step 7: Talk to Aura

1. Open Slack and DM Aura. Say anything -- "Hey, what's up?"
2. Aura should respond within a few seconds
3. In a channel, invite Aura (`/invite @Aura`) and then mention it: "@Aura what do you think about TypeScript?"

That's it. Aura is live.

---

## Local Development

For local development, run the Hono server directly:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts a local server on `http://localhost:3000`. To receive Slack events locally, you need a tunnel:

```bash
# Using ngrok
ngrok http 3000
```

Then update the Slack Event Subscriptions URL to your tunnel URL (`https://xxx.ngrok.io/api/slack/events`).

**Note:** AI Gateway authenticates automatically via OIDC when deployed on Vercel. For local development, run `vercel env pull` to get a local `.env` with the right credentials, or use `vercel dev` which handles auth automatically.

**Drizzle Studio** lets you browse the database:

```bash
npm run db:studio
```

## How It Works

### Message flow

```
Slack event arrives
  -> POST /api/slack/events
  -> Acknowledge immediately (200 OK within 3 seconds)
  -> Background: run pipeline
       1. Parse context (who, where, thread?)
       2. Should we respond? (DMs: always. Channels: only if @mentioned)
       3. Retrieve memories (embed query -> pgvector similarity search)
       4. Fetch user profile (tone adaptation hints)
       5. Build system prompt (personality + memories + profile + thread)
       6. Call LLM via AI Gateway
       7. Post-process (strip sycophantic openers, AI disclaimers)
       8. Format for Slack and send reply
       9. Background: store messages, extract memories, update profile
```

### Memory extraction

After every exchange, a separate LLM call (fast model) extracts structured memories:

- **Facts** -- "The Q3 launch date is March 15"
- **Decisions** -- "We decided to use Postgres instead of MongoDB"
- **Personal** -- "Tom has a dog named Biscuit"
- **Relationships** -- "Joan and Maria work closely on mobile"
- **Sentiments** -- "Joan seemed frustrated about deploys"
- **Open threads** -- "Joan asked about API docs, no answer yet"

Each memory is embedded and stored with its vector for semantic retrieval.

### Privacy

DM-sourced memories are **private by default**. They're only surfaced when:
- The current user is in the memory's `related_user_ids`, OR
- The user explicitly told Aura to share (e.g., "Tell Maria I approved the budget")

Channel messages are treated as shared knowledge.

### Memory consolidation

A daily cron job (4:00 AM UTC) runs:
- **Decay**: multiplies all relevance scores by 0.995 (~50% after 138 days)
- **Dedup**: finds memories with >95% cosine similarity, merges them
- Old memories are deprioritized but never deleted

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Yes | Neon PostgreSQL connection string |
| `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` | Yes | Slack bot token (`xoxb-...`) |
| `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` | Yes | Slack app signing secret |
| `AURA_BOT_USER_ID` | Yes | Slack user ID for the bot (`U...`) |
| `MODEL_MAIN` | No | Main conversation model (default: `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514`) |
| `MODEL_FAST` | No | Fast model for extraction (default: `anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5`) |
| `MODEL_EMBEDDING` | No | Embedding model (default: `openai/text-embedding-3-small`) |
| `CRON_SECRET` | Recommended | Protects the `/api/cron/consolidate` endpoint |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | No | `debug`, `info` (default), `warn`, `error` |

No provider API keys needed -- AI Gateway handles provider access and billing through your Vercel account.

---

## Switching Models

Just change the env vars. No code changes needed.

```bash
# Use OpenAI for everything
MODEL_MAIN=openai/gpt-4o
MODEL_FAST=openai/gpt-4o-mini
MODEL_EMBEDDING=openai/text-embedding-3-small

# Use Google
MODEL_MAIN=google/gemini-2.5-pro
MODEL_FAST=google/gemini-2.5-flash
MODEL_EMBEDDING=google/text-embedding-005

# Mix and match
MODEL_MAIN=anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514
MODEL_FAST=google/gemini-2.5-flash
MODEL_EMBEDDING=voyage/voyage-3.5-lite
```

Then redeploy (or restart locally). The AI Gateway handles routing to the right provider.

**Note on embedding dimensions:** The database schema uses 1536-dimensional vectors (matching `openai/text-embedding-3-small`). If you switch to an embedding model with different dimensions, you'll need to update the vector size in `src/db/schema.ts` and re-run the migration.

---

## Customizing Aura's Personality

The personality is defined in `src/personality/system-prompt.ts`. It's a TypeScript template string, version-controlled, and deliberately editable. The key sections:

- **Who you are** -- core traits (direct, warm, concise, opinionated, witty, curious, self-aware)
- **How you communicate** -- formatting rules, energy matching
- **What you NEVER do** -- hard anti-patterns (no sycophancy, no disclaimers, no "delve")
- **How you disagree** -- push back with evidence, accept gracefully when overruled
- **How you use memory** -- reference naturally, don't force, be specific

The anti-pattern post-processor in `src/personality/anti-patterns.ts` acts as a safety net -- it strips common AI-isms that leak through despite the prompt.

---

## Database Management

```bash
# Push schema changes to the database
npm run db:push

# Generate a migration (if you prefer migration files)
npm run db:generate

# Open Drizzle Studio (database browser)
npm run db:studio
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**Aura doesn't respond to DMs**

- Check that `im:history` and `im:read` scopes are added
- Make sure the `message.im` event subscription is enabled
- Verify `AURA_BOT_USER_ID` matches the bot's actual Slack user ID

**Aura doesn't respond to @mentions in channels**

- Invite Aura to the channel first (`/invite @Aura`)
- Check that `app_mention` event subscription is enabled
- Check that `channels:history` and `chat:write` scopes are added

**"Invalid signature" in logs**

- Verify `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` matches the one in your Slack app's Basic Information page
- If using a tunnel (ngrok), make sure you're not double-proxying

**Slack shows "dispatch_failed" or retries events**

- The initial 200 OK wasn't received within 3 seconds
- Check Vercel function logs for startup errors
- Make sure all env vars are set in Vercel (not just locally)

**LLM calls fail with authentication errors**

- Make sure AI Gateway is enabled on your Vercel project
- Check that OIDC auth is working -- redeploy if it was recently enabled
- For local dev, run `vercel env pull` or use `vercel dev`

**Memory retrieval returns nothing**

- Check that the `pgvector` extension is enabled: `SELECT * FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'vector';`
- Verify memories exist: `SELECT count(*) FROM memories WHERE embedding IS NOT NULL;`
- The HNSW index is created automatically by the migration

**High latency (>5 seconds)**

- Check Vercel function region -- deploy close to your Neon database region
- LLM response time varies by provider/model (typically 2-5 seconds)
- Memory retrieval adds ~200-500ms for the embedding call
